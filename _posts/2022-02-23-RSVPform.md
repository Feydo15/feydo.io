# introduction 
Today i was busy doing an RSVP form Project  which i have learned so much from

# body

i used html and css on my rsvp and i have used most of the things that i have learned
about before like in html i had a recap on how to make different types of input like email,tel,and
date, i also structured my code in such a way that most of my elements where nested withing the 
div elements with classes so that i can target them straight when styling them in css 

and in css i mostly did a recap on  adding image that is stored in a folder as a background by just using the url(), giving my form a grid view and 
making my form have a glassy background .

# conclusion
this kind of projects are very helpful for recap on some of the things i have learned about
before and i get to understand them better.
