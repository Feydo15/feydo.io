# Introduction
 today have managed to create a context page and update the Home page. 

# body

i created a context page and updated the cart context page so that they can be in the same page and 
as soon as i'm done i will have to merge the cart with the user so that it can have same id in the storage
 i also
added the browser section in my home page which is still await the functionality of the filter buttons 
and search text bar i have created the functions already in the context i just have to pass them to
their individual buttons.

i removed the lorem text on my about section and added a meaningful p tag and i did the same for
"our style" section. i also separated the header and the footer from all my app page and rendered them 
directly from the app.js file 



# conclusion
i didn't manage to update app to remember the user's cart 
i did typing for extra 20 min after 4pm
