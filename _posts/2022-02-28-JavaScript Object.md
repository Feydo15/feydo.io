# introduction
Today i have learned about how to "Create a Basic JavaScript Object" 

under the object oriented programming of 
js

# body

When we create a basic javaScript object we use all the qualities of a real life objects like 
cars, shops and more. some qualities of this object are a car has wheels, shops sell items. and birds
have wings
all this qualities define what makes up an object and similar objects shear qualities but may have
different values for those properties for example all cars have wheels, but not all cars have same number of wheels.

objects in Js are used to model real-world objects, giving them properties and behavior just like their real-world counterparts.for example 
<let bird = { name: "rodny" numLegs:2}>

this bird object has tow property / value pairs: a name of rodny and numLegs of 2


# conclusion

we can create any object in js just like the real world object and we can give them the same properties. i have enjoyed working on this challenges and i had a good understanding than all i have 
done before.
