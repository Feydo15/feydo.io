# Introduction

Today i have learned about how to Target the Children of an Element Using jQuery under
the Front End Development Libraries.

# body
When HTML elements are placed one level below another they are called children of that element.
less take this HTMLcode for example:
<div class="container-fluid">
  <h3 class="text-primary text-center">jQuery Playground</h3>
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-xs-6">
      <h4>#left-well</h4>
      <div class="well" id="left-well">
        <button class="btn btn-default target" id="target1">#target1</button>
        <button class="btn btn-default target" id="target2">#target2</button>
        <button class="btn btn-default target" id="target3">#target3</button>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="col-xs-6">
      <h4>#right-well</h4>
      <div class="well" id="right-well">
        <button class="btn btn-default target" id="target4">#target4</button>
        <button class="btn btn-default target" id="target5">#target5</button>
        <button class="btn btn-default target" id="target6">#target6</button>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

well on this code the button elements in this challenge with the text #target1, #target2, and #target3 are all children of the <div class="well" id="left-well"> element.
jQuery has a function called children() that allows you to access the children of whichever element you've selected.

Here's an example of how we would use the children() function to give the children of our left-well element the color blue:<$("#left-well").children().css("color", "blue")>

now less give  all the children of your right-well element the color orange together:
<script>
  $(document).ready(function() {
   $("#right-well").children().css("color", "orange")   
      });
</script>

# conclusion
jQuery has all the little functions that makes it easy to work with many elements 
and it makes it easy to target them one by one.
