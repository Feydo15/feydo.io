-How did the week go? (Paragraph)

The week for me was very hectic as I had to study for the PL200 Exam in a very short time.
I had to manage the work load of PL200 beacuse it is a very diverse module with too much work so i had to come up with a way of splitting it in smaller potions.I had to try to manage studing in a noisy environment.
All in all I can say I was able to grasp a lot of information based PL200 even though it was not enogh.

- I completed the PL200 cource.
