# Introduction

Today i have learned about how to Target Even Elements Using jQuery
 under
the Front End Development Libraries.

# body

We can also target elements based on their positions using :odd or :even selectors.
Note that jQuery is zero-indexed which means the first element in a selection has a position of 0. This can be a little confusing as, counter-intuitively, :odd selects the second element (position 1), fourth element (position 3), and so on.

less take this HTML code for example:
<div class="container-fluid">
  <h3 class="text-primary text-center">jQuery Playground</h3>
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-xs-6">
      <h4>#left-well</h4>
      <div class="well" id="left-well">
        <button class="btn btn-default target" id="target1">#target1</button>
        <button class="btn btn-default target" id="target2">#target2</button>
        <button class="btn btn-default target" id="target3">#target3</button>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="col-xs-6">
      <h4>#right-well</h4>
      <div class="well" id="right-well">
        <button class="btn btn-default target" id="target4">#target4</button>
        <button class="btn btn-default target" id="target5">#target5</button>
        <button class="btn btn-default target" id="target6">#target6</button>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

Here's how we would target all the odd elements with class target and give them classes:
$(".target:odd").addClass("animated shake");

Now less try selecting all the even target elements and giving them the classes of animated and shake. Remember that even refers to the position of elements with a zero-based system in mind.

<script>
  $(document).ready(function() {
   $(".target:even").addClass("animated shake");   
       });
</script>

# conclusion
in jQuery every element can be targeted easy using classes and ids.
