# introduction 

I have learned about how to use the javascript console to check the value of a variable 
and understanding the differences between the free code camp and browser console
as well as how to use typeof to check the type of a variable.

# body

The console.log() method prints the output of what`s within its parentheses to the console.
it is likely the most helpful debugging tool.If you place it at strategic points in your code it can 
show you the intermediate values of variables. 

The free code camp console is a little different from the browser console as some challenges
on FCC include their own console that behaves a little differently from the browser console.

there are many methods to use with console to output messages like log, warn, and clear to name a few
but the free code camp only output log massages while the browser will output all.

Typeof is used to check the data structure or type of a variable.
it is useful in debugging when working with multiple data types.

# conclusion

debugging tools are very useful when checking your code and know how your output will be while still 
busy with your code
