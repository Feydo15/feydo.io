# Introduction

 today have managed to fix the filter component and provide it with the correct functionality from the context. 
 
# body

My filter component has five filter methods that return items based on the conditions defined in the context.
i have added the methods and i also need to filter by gender since i doing a clothing app. 
the app context is giving me problems since i can't connect it to the cart.


i tried to add the getItem function which should return the cart state from the local host  but i still can't 
initialize the state with the state from the local host.
i need to create 2 more functions that will help me with returning the cart state from the local host every time
the app reload.

i did type practice for 1 and half hour today and i have managed to type without looking at the keyboard.

# conclusion
i didn't manage to update app to remember the user's cart 
i still need to add the gender filter function to the filter component.
