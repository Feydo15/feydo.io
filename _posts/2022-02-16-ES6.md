What i have learned today based on Strings using Template Literals and object Literals



# body

Es6 has new features like template Literal and Object literal .
Template literal is a special string that makes creating complex strings easier it 
allows you to create multi-line stings and use interpolation(The insertion of something of a different nature into something else)
features to create strings

With ES6 you can write Concise Object Literal Declarations Using Object Property Shorthand.
