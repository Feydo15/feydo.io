# introduction
ES6 Array functions or methods



# body
What i have learned today is about the ES6 which refer to 
JavaScript ES6 (also known as ECMAScript 2015 or ECMAScript 6) is the newer version of JavaScript that was introduced in 2015.
ECMAScript provides the specification on how JavaScript programming language should work.

we have different methods under ES6 like the object.freeze under Prevent Object Mutation and the arrow functions
and more but today i only did up to the arrow functions and i understand that while writing the arrow function you must use const and u can also
use Arrow Functions to Write Concise Anonymous Functions.


I also did the the typing club for 45 min today and i think i am getting used to the keys on the key board

# conclusion
I still need to redo this course from scratch so that i can have a better understanding
