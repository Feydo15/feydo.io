# Introduction

Today i have learned about how to Store Data with Sass Variables
under
the Front End Development Libraries.

# body

One feature of Sass that's different than CSS is it uses variables. They are declared and set to store data, similar to JavaScript.
In JavaScript, variables are defined using the let and const keywords. In Sass, variables start with a $ followed by the variable name.
Here are a couple examples:<$main-fonts: Arial, sans-serif;
$headings-color: green;>
And to use the variables:<h1 {
font-family: $main-fonts;
color: $headings-color;
}>

One example where variables are useful is when a number of elements need to be the same color. If that color is changed, the only place to edit the code is the variable value.

now less create a variable $text-color and set it to red. Then change the value of the color property for the .blog-post and h2 to the $text-color variable.

we first need to write our h2 and the blog post div like this.
<<div class="blog-post">

  <h2>Some random title</h2>
  <p>This is a paragraph with some random text in it</p>
</div>>

then in our style element we create our variable like this:
<<style>
$text-color: red;
.blog-post, h2{
color: $text-color;
}
</style>>

this will make the .blog-post div and the h2 color to be red.

# conclusion

Sass makes styling easier since we can use one color that is stored in a variable more than once
by just reusing the variable
