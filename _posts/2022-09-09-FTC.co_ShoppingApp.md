# Introduction
today have managed to update the cart items to get stored on local storage on the FTC.co_shopping app 

# body
i have managed to use the useEffect hook to update the cart state and also send the state to the 
local storage. i also added the uuid to the users in the local storage which i still have to use
to connect both cart and the user in the local storage.
NB The id on the cart has to match the id of the user in the local storage.

i also managed to create my own JSON file and i removed the one that i borrowed from Faker.json
and connected the one i created.

now i have to update my context page so that it can contain all the app state (both cart"items" and app"users" ), 
I also need to create_active users array in the local storage that will hold all the users's actions n it will only be active while the user is logged in and if the user checks out
it will be terminated from the local storage.

# conclusion
i didn't manage to update app to remember the user's cart 
i still have to host my context on one place.
