# Introduction
today i have learned about how to Connect Redux to the Messages App under React and Redux.
 Redux can be used within the context of any UI framework, 
though it is most commonly paired with React. This makes sense considering that React 
and Redux were both developed by engineers at Facebook.

# body

the component we connected to Redux was named Presentational, and this wasn't arbitrary. This term generally refers to React components that are not directly connected to Redux. They are simply responsible for the presentation of UI and do this as a function of the props they receive. By contrast, container components are connected to Redux. These are typically responsible for dispatching actions to the store and often pass store state to child components as props.

so less take this code for example:now less Create a new component held in a constant called Container that uses connect to connect the Presentational component to Redux. Then, in the AppWrapper, render the React Redux Provider component. Pass Provider the Redux store as a prop and render Container as a child.
 <// Redux:
const ADD = 'ADD';

const addMessage = (message) => {
  return {
    type: ADD,
    message: message
  }
};

const messageReducer = (state = [], action) => {
  switch (action.type) {
    case ADD:
      return [
        ...state,
        action.message
      ];
    default:
      return state;
  }
};

const store = Redux.createStore(messageReducer);

// React:
class Presentational extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {
      input: '',
      messages: []
    }
    this.handleChange = this.handleChange.bind(this);
    this.submitMessage = this.submitMessage.bind(this);
  }
  handleChange(event) {
    this.setState({
      input: event.target.value
    });
  }
  submitMessage() {
    const currentMessage = this.state.input;
    this.setState({
      input: '',
      messages: this.state.messages.concat(currentMessage)
    });
  }
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <h2>Type in a new Message:</h2>
        <input
          value={this.state.input}
          onChange={this.handleChange}/><br/>
        <button onClick={this.submitMessage}>Submit</button>
        <ul>
          {this.state.messages.map( (message, idx) => {
              return (
                 <li key={idx}>{message}</li>
              )
            })
          }
        </ul>
      </div>
    );
  }
};

// React-Redux:
const mapStateToProps = (state) => {
  return { messages: state }
};

const mapDispatchToProps = (dispatch) => {
  return {
    submitNewMessage: (newMessage) => {
       dispatch(addMessage(newMessage))
    }
  }
};

const Provider = ReactRedux.Provider;
const connect = ReactRedux.connect;

// define the Container component here:
const Container = connect(mapStateToProps,mapDispatchToProps)(Presentational)

class AppWrapper extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
  }
  render() {
    // complete the return statement:
    return (
      <Provider store={store}>
        <Container />
      </Provider>
      );
  }
};>
# conclusion
Once everything is setup, you will see the messages app rendered to the page again.
