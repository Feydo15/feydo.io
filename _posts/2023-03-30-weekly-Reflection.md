# Introduction
Weekly Reflection

# body
-How did the week go? (Paragraph)

The week for me was very hectic as I had to learn both C# (C Sharp) and Power Apps in a very short time.
I had to manage both C# and PowerApps and try to allocate equal time to both of them, Even though I did my 
best on time management I had a challenge of over concentrating on one of them for so long.
All in all I can say I was able to grasp a lot of information based on C# and Power Apps.


-The important things i got done this week? (Bullets)

- I did the Lebs on Power Apps
- I did the environment setup for .Net 7 on my Vs code
- I stated the Inventory Management System webAPI 
- I did a research on C#


-The important things i want to get done next week? (Bullets)

- Join the online class
- do all the lebs for the class
- Try to make time to work on the IMS app 
- Practice more C#

-Things i'am blocked on, need help with or would like to ask? (Paragraph or bullets)
