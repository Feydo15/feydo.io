# Introduction

Today i have learned about how to Nest CSS with Sass
under
the Front End Development Libraries.

# body

Sass allows nesting of CSS rules, which is a useful way of organizing a style sheet.
Normally, each element is targeted on a different line to style it, like so:<nav {
background-color: red;
}

nav ul {
list-style: none;
}

nav ul li {
display: inline-block;
}>

For a large project, the CSS file will have many lines and rules. This is where nesting can help organize our code by placing child style rules within the respective parent elements:<nav {
background-color: red;

ul {
list-style: none;

    li {
      display: inline-block;
    }

}
}

>

now less use the nesting technique shown above to re-organize the CSS rules for both children of .blog-post element. For testing purposes, the h1 should come before the p element.

we first need to write our h1 and the blog post div like this.
<<div class="blog-post">

  <h1>Blog Title</h1>
  <p>This is a paragraph</p>
</div>>

then in our style element we create our variable like this:
<<style type='text/scss'>
.blog-post {
h1 {
text-align: center;
color: blue;}

      p {
    font-size: 20px;
}
}
</style>>

# conclusion

this helps us to organize our code so that we can use less lines of code provided we have a long code
